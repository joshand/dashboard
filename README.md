# dashboard

# Description
The dashboard is a demonstration environment that I am using for API integration and other purposes. It is set up so that I can add APIs and other applications. Currently, there is one application integrated, called EasyCCX. It is used to demonstrate cloud script management for Cisco Contact Center Express.

# Installation

## Environment
* Requires pico2wave for TTS. I had trouble finding this in repos, so I had to build. I used build instructions <a href='http://pbxinaflash.com/community/threads/svox-pico-tts-for-asterisk.17859/'>here</a><br>
* Requires sox for u-law audio conversion.<br>
* Build your database by importing the included database
